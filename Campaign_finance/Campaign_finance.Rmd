Loading in contribution data from multiple campaigns for the 2022 annual filing period:
```{r}
## Kelly Schulz, R
schulz_data <- read_csv("Schulz_ContributionsList.csv")
## Tom Perez, D
perez_data <- read_csv("Perez_ContributionsList.csv")
## Peter Franchot, D
franchot_data <- read_csv("Franchot_ContributionsList.csv")
## Wes Moore, D
moore_data <- read_csv("Moore_ContributionsList.csv")
## John King, D
king_data <- read_csv("King_ContributionsList.csv")
## Rushern Baker, D
baker_data <- read_csv("Baker_ContributionsList.csv")
## Doug Gansler, D
gansler_data <- read_csv("Gansler_ContributionsList.csv")
```
I want to join all of these dataframes together to make for less redundancy in the exploration. Before that, I am going to mutate the Receiving Committee column to make it easier to organize which campaign each donation is for.
```{r}
#Schulz
schulz_data <- schulz_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Schulz")
#Perez
perez_data <- perez_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Perez")
#Franchot
franchot_data <- franchot_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Franchot")
#Moore
moore_data <- moore_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Moore")
#King
king_data <- king_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "King")
#Baker
baker_data <- baker_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Baker")
#Gansler
gansler_data <- gansler_data %>%
  mutate(`Receiving Committee` = "Gansler")
```
Now I want to join all of these dataframes together.
```{r}
master_data <- bind_rows(schulz_data, perez_data, franchot_data, moore_data, king_data, baker_data, gansler_data)
```
The dataframes are kind of messy. One of the first things I want to do is make a state column and populate it with the state from which the contribution came from. 
```{r}
master_data_new <- master_data %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "MD") ~ "Maryland",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "Md") ~ "Maryland",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "FL") ~ "Florida",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "MI") ~ "Michigan",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "VA") ~ "Virginia",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "DC") ~ "Washington, D.C.",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "WI") ~ "Wisconsin",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "WV") ~ "West Virginia",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "NC") ~ "North Carolina",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "PA") ~ "Pennsylvania",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "TX") ~ "Texas",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "IL") ~ "Illinois",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "CO") ~ "Colorado",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "GA") ~ "Georgia",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "SC") ~ "South Carolina",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "ME") ~ "Maine",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "MO") ~ "Missouri",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "AZ") ~ "Arizona",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "NJ") ~ "New Jersey",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "CA") ~ "California",

    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "OR") ~ "Oregon",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "MA") ~ "Massachusetts",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "HI") ~ "Hawaii",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "PR") ~ "Puerto Rico",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "MN") ~ "Minnesota",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "NH") ~ "New Hampshire",

    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "WY") ~ "Wyoming",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "UT") ~ "Utah",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "NM") ~ "New Mexico",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "KY") ~ "Kentucky",
    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "SD") ~ "South Dakota",

    str_detect(`Contributor Address`, "AS") ~ "American Somoa"
  ))

master_data_new %>%
  filter(is.na(state))
```
I also want to drop all entries in the dataframe that are either from out of the country or do not have a state listed. I'll do that here. This removes 16 entries from the dataset. 
```{r}
master_data_new <- master_data_new %>%
  drop_na(state)
```
Now that that is done, another thing I wanted to do was standardize the date column so that I can use that column for exploration.
```{r}
master_data_new <- master_data_new %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(`Contribution Date`, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
```
Now I can do some surface level exploration: what is the average amount of donation for each campaign? Which had the most donations from out of state? Who raised the most in the first half of 2021? The last half? In 2022 so far? 
```{r}
## who lead the way in total fundraising
master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(sum(`Contribution Amount`))
## average donation for each campaign
master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(`Contribution Amount`), list(name = mean))

## Franchot has the highest average donation amount at just over $900. Baker has the lowest, at $112. Could this be skewed by large donations from corporations? I am going to filter to just individual contributions to see if the trend is the same.
master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Contributor Type` == "Individual") %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(`Contribution Amount`), list(name = mean))

## Franchot still leads the way, at $774 dollars on average. Baker is still at the bottom, with $175. 

## What about where candidates were getting money? Who was collecting a lot of donations from out of state?

## To figure this out, it is going to be helpful to add a column to the dataframe that simply indicates if a contribution came from inside of Maryland or from a different state

master_data_new <- master_data_new %>%
  mutate(in_state = case_when(
    str_detect(state, "Maryland") ~ "True",
    TRUE ~ "False"
  ))

## Now I can check
master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`, in_state) %>%
  count()

## I can see just from glancing at the numbers that Franchot is collection a lot of donations from inside the state, while candidates like Moore, King and Perez are financed heavily by out-of-state donations. I want to find the % of donations that came from out of state for each campaign.
in_state <- master_data_new %>%
  filter(in_state == "True") %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  count() 
total <- master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  count()
in_state_percentage <- total %>%
  left_join(in_state, b=c("Receiving Committee")) %>%
  mutate(in_state_perc = (n.y/n.x)*100)

## Schulz pulled in the highest % of her donations from in Maryland, with almost 96%. Franchot led the Democratic side, with almost 85%. Baker was close behind. Moore, King and Perez receieved a good amount of out-of-state donations. 

## But what about % of total money raised? How much of that came from out of state for each candidate?
in_state_money <- master_data_new %>%
  filter(in_state == "True") %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(y = sum(`Contribution Amount`))

total_money <- master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(x = sum(`Contribution Amount`))

in_state_money_perc <- in_state_money %>%
  left_join(total_money, b=c("Receiving Committee") )%>%
  mutate(in_state_perc = (y/x)*100)

## The dynamics change a little bit — Schulz still has over 90% of her money coming from in-state, but Franchot drops to 78% and Baker down to 82%. Moore is at 42% and King sits at just 11%.

## For some of the more notable campagins that are receiving a lot of out-of-state money — Moore, King, Perez — where is it coming from? What states pop up the most?
master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Receiving Committee` == "Perez" | `Receiving Committee` == "Moore" | `Receiving Committee` == "King") %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`, state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

## King and Moore both received a lot of donations from New York and California. Perez had a lot of contributions from California as well. A map that shows these numbers might be interesting.

## The reports also designate who was donating — an individual, a company/organization, a PAC Committe. I want to see how that breaks down for each candidate.
master_data_new %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`, `Contributor Type`) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

## A couple quick observations: Franchot pulled in the most contributions from both Businesses/organizations as well as PACs. Schulz also pulled in a lot of contributions from businesses. Moore had by far the most contributions from individuals. I am going to explore some of these a bit more specifically. 

## Franchot: how much money did he make from PACs?
master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Receiving Committee` == "Franchot" & `Contributor Type` == "PAC Committee")  %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`))
  
master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Contributor Type` == "PAC Committee")  %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`))

## only four candidates received money from PACs, and Perez leads the way in money with $20k. Schulz pulled in $11.5k and Franchot had $9k.

## Who made the most from businesses?
master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Contributor Type` == "Business/Group/Organization")  %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

## Franchot made the most from businesses/groups/organizations, with just under $465k. Schulz made $427k.

master_data_new %>%
  filter(`Contributor Type` == "Business/Group/Organization") %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(`Contribution Amount`), list(name = mean)) %>%
  arrange(desc(name))

## I am also curious how the timeline of fundraising happened. Did someone come on strong at the end of the year? Has someone started lagging? 

master_data_new %>%
  filter(date <= as.Date("2021-07-31")) %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

## Before the end of July, Moore had raised $1.5 million. King had raised $1 million. Schulz hauled in $620k. Franchot had made just under $328k. 

master_data_new %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("2021-08-01")) %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

## After July, Moore raised the most again, with $2.57 million. Perez really stepped up the fundraising, making $1.86 million. Franchot also made up the large gap, making $1.3 million. 

master_data_new %>%
  filter(date >= as.Date("2022-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(`Receiving Committee`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

## Since the start of 2022, Perez has made the most, with $490k. Moore has made $452k and Franchot has hauled in $352k. 

## What zip codes in Maryland donated the most money? 

zips <- master_data_new %>%
  filter(state == "Maryland") %>%
  mutate(zip = str_extract(`Contributor Address`, "MD \\d{5}"))

zips <- zips %>%
  mutate(zip = str_remove(zip, "MD "))

moore_zips <- zips %>%
  filter(`Receiving Committee` == "Moore")

md_zips_totals <- zips %>%
  group_by(zip) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Contribution Amount`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

md_zips <- get_acs(geography = "zcta",
                  variables = c(population = "B01001_001"),
                  state = "MD")

md_zips <- md_zips %>%
  select(GEOID, estimate)

md_zips_joined <- md_zips_totals %>%
  left_join(md_zips, by=c("zip"="GEOID")) %>%
  mutate(per_100k = (total/estimate)*100000) %>%
  arrange(desc(per_100k)) %>%
  slice(-1,-2, -3)
``` 
I want to write a couple of CSVs to export and use for data visualization for a quick story memo for my editors. I am going to write them here.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
